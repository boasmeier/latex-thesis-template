	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Due to complicated and variable fundus status of highly myopic eyes, their visual benefit from cataract surgery remains hard to be determined preoperatively. We therefore aimed to develop an optical coherence tomography ({OCT})-based deep learning algorithms to predict the postoperative visual acuity of highly myopic eyes after cataract surgery.
{MATERIALS} {AND} {METHODS}: The internal dataset consisted of 1,415 highly myopic eyes having cataract surgeries in our hospital. Another external dataset consisted of 161 highly myopic eyes from Heping Eye Hospital. Preoperative macular {OCT} images were set as the only feature. The best corrected visual acuity ({BCVA}) at 4 weeks after surgery was set as the ground truth. Five different deep learning algorithms, namely {ResNet}-18, {ResNet}-34, {ResNet}-50, {ResNet}-101, and Inception-v3, were used to develop the model aiming at predicting the postoperative {BCVA}, and an ensemble learning was further developed. The model was further evaluated in the internal and external test datasets.
{RESULTS}: The ensemble learning showed the lowest mean absolute error ({MAE}) of 0.1566 {logMAR} and the lowest root mean square error ({RMSE}) of 0.2433 {logMAR} in the validation dataset. Promising outcomes in the internal and external test datasets were revealed with {MAEs} of 0.1524 and 0.1602 {logMAR} and {RMSEs} of 0.2612 and 0.2020 {logMAR}, respectively. Considerable sensitivity and precision were achieved in the {BCVA} {\textless} 0.30 {logMAR} group, with 90.32 and 75.34\% in the internal test dataset and 81.75 and 89.60\% in the external test dataset, respectively. The percentages of the prediction errors within ± 0.30 {logMAR} were 89.01\% in the internal and 88.82\% in the external test dataset.
{CONCLUSION}: Promising prediction outcomes of postoperative {BCVA} were achieved by the novel {OCT}-trained deep learning model, which will be helpful for the surgical planning of highly myopic cataract patients.},

In total, 3331 eyes from 2010 patients were assessed. The objects were divided into training data and test data. The constants for the {IOL} power calculation formulas and model training for {ML} were optimized using training data. Then, the occurrence of postoperative refraction was predicted using conventional formulas, or {ML} models were calculated using the test data. We evaluated the {SRK}/T formula, Haigis formula, Holladay 1 formula, Hoffer Q formula, and Barrett Universal {II} formula ({BU}-{II}); similar to {ML} methods, we assessed support vector regression ({SVR}), random forest regression ({RFR}), gradient boosting regression ({GBR}), and neural network ({NN}). Among the conventional formulas, {BU}-{II} had the lowest mean and median absolute error of prediction. Therefore, we compared the accuracy of our method with that of {BU}-{II}. The absolute errors of some {ML} methods were lower than those of {BU}-{II}. However, no statistically significant difference was observed. Thus, the accuracy of our method was not inferior to that of {BU}-{II}.},

	abstract = {{OBJECTIVE}: To predict post-operative depth of focus ({DoF}) using machine learning techniques after cataract surgery with Tecnis Symfony implantation and determine associated impact factors.
{METHODS}: This was a retrospective cohort study among patients receiving Tecnis Symfony implantation, an extended-range-of-vision intraocular lens, during October 2016-January 2020 at Daqing Oilfield General Hospital, China. Four different predictive models were used to predict good post-operative {DoF} (⩾2.5 D): Extreme Gradient Boost ({XGBoost}), random forest ({RF}), {LASSO} penalized regression, and multivariable logistic regression ({MLR}). Apriori algorithm was employed to further explore the association between patient attributes and {DoF}.
{RESULTS}: A total of 182 unique cases (143 patients) were included. The {XGBoost} model produced the best predictive accuracy compared to {RF}, {LASSO}, and {MLR} models. Overall performance of the best fitting {XGBoost} model was as follows: accuracy = 70.3\%, {AUC} = 80.2\%, sensitivity = 65.5\%, and specificity = 87.5\%. The Apriori algorithm identified six preoparative attributes with substantial effects on good post-operative {DoF}: low anterior chamber depth ({ACD}) (1.9 to {\textless}2.5 mm), smaller pupil size (1.7 to {\textless}2.5 mm), low-to-mid axial length (21 to {\textless}23 mm), minimum astigmatism degree (-0.2 to 0 diopter), low {IOP} (9 to {\textless}12 {mmHg}), and medium lens target refractive error (-0.5 to {\textless}-0.25 diopter).
{CONCLUSIONS}: Machine Learning models were able to predict good post-operative {DoF} among cataract patients receiving a Tecnis Symfony ocular lens implantation. The accuracy of the model was above 70\%. The Apriori algorithm identified six preoperative attributes with a strong association with post-operative {DoF}.},

	abstract = {{ABSTRACT}: Corneal diseases, uncorrected refractive errors, and cataract represent the major causes of blindness globally. The number of refractive surgeries, either cornea- or lens-based, is also on the rise as the demand for perfect vision continues to increase. With the recent advancement and potential promises of artificial intelligence ({AI}) technologies demonstrated in the realm of ophthalmology, particularly retinal diseases and glaucoma, {AI} researchers and clinicians are now channeling their focus toward the less explored ophthalmic areas related to the anterior segment of the eye. Conditions that rely on anterior segment imaging modalities, including slit-lamp photography, anterior segment optical coherence tomography, corneal tomography, in vivo confocal microscopy and/or optical biometers, are the most commonly explored areas. These include infectious keratitis, keratoconus, corneal grafts, ocular surface pathologies, preoperative screening before refractive surgery, intraocular lens calculation, and automated refraction, among others. In this review, we aimed to provide a comprehensive update on the utilization of {AI} in anterior segment diseases, with particular emphasis on the recent advancement in the past few years. In addition, we demystify some of the basic principles and terminologies related to {AI}, particularly machine learning and deep learning, to help improve the understanding, research and clinical implementation of these {AI} technologies among the ophthalmologists and vision scientists. As we march toward the era of digital health, guidelines such as {CONSORT}-{AI}, {SPIRIT}-{AI}, and {STARD}-{AI} will play crucial roles in guiding and standardizing the conduct and reporting of {AI}-related trials, ultimately promoting their potential for clinical translation.},

	abstract = {The "Roaring 20s" of visual recognition began with the introduction of Vision Transformers ({ViTs}), which quickly superseded {ConvNets} as the state-of-the-art image classification model. A vanilla {ViT}, on the other hand, faces difficulties when applied to general computer vision tasks such as object detection and semantic segmentation. It is the hierarchical Transformers (e.g., Swin Transformers) that reintroduced several {ConvNet} priors, making Transformers practically viable as a generic vision backbone and demonstrating remarkable performance on a wide variety of vision tasks. However, the effectiveness of such hybrid approaches is still largely credited to the intrinsic superiority of Transformers, rather than the inherent inductive biases of convolutions. In this work, we reexamine the design spaces and test the limits of what a pure {ConvNet} can achieve. We gradually "modernize" a standard {ResNet} toward the design of a vision Transformer, and discover several key components that contribute to the performance difference along the way. The outcome of this exploration is a family of pure {ConvNet} models dubbed {ConvNeXt}. Constructed entirely from standard {ConvNet} modules, {ConvNeXts} compete favorably with Transformers in terms of accuracy and scalability, achieving 87.8\% {ImageNet} top-1 accuracy and outperforming Swin Transformers on {COCO} detection and {ADE}20K segmentation, while maintaining the simplicity and efficiency of standard {ConvNets}.},

	abstract = {Evaluating corneal morphologic characteristics with corneal tomographic scans before refractive surgery is necessary to exclude patients with at-risk corneas and keratoconus. In previous studies, researchers performed screening with machine learning methods based on specific corneal parameters. To date, a deep learning algorithm has not been used in combination with corneal tomographic scans.To examine the use of a deep learning model in the screening of candidates for refractive surgery.A diagnostic, cross-sectional study was conducted at the Zhongshan Ophthalmic Center, Guangzhou, China, with examination dates extending from July 18, 2016, to March 29, 2019. The investigation was performed from July 2, 2018, to June 28, 2019. Participants included 1385 patients; 6465 corneal tomographic images were used to generate the artificial intelligence ({AI}) model. The Pentacam {HR} system was used for data collection.The deidentified images were analyzed by ophthalmologists and the {AI} model.The performance of the {AI} classification system.A classification system centered on the {AI} model Pentacam {InceptionResNetV}2 Screening System ({PIRSS}) was developed for screening potential candidates for refractive surgery. The model achieved an overall detection accuracy of 94.7\% (95\% {CI}, 93.3\%-95.8\%) on the validation data set. Moreover, on the independent test data set, the {PIRSS} model achieved an overall detection accuracy of 95\% (95\% {CI}, 88.8\%-97.8\%), which was comparable with that of senior ophthalmologists who are refractive surgeons (92.8\%; 95\% {CI}, 91.2\%-94.4\%) (P = .72). In distinguishing corneas with contraindications for refractive surgery, the {PIRSS} model performed better than the classifiers (95\% vs 81\%; P \&lt; .001) in the Pentacam {HR} system on an Asian patient database.{PIRSS} appears to be useful in classifying images to provide corneal information and preliminarily identify at-risk corneas. {PIRSS} may provide guidance to refractive surgeons in screening candidates for refractive surgery as well as for generalized clinical application for Asian patients, but its use needs to be confirmed in other populations.},
