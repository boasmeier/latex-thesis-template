	abstract = {The present study aims to describe the use of machine learning ({ML}) in predicting the occurrence of postoperative refraction after cataract surgery and compares the accuracy of this method to conventional intraocular lens ({IOL}) power calculation formulas. In total, 3331 eyes from 2010 patients were assessed. The objects were divided into training data and test data. The constants for the {IOL} power calculation formulas and model training for {ML} were optimized using training data. Then, the occurrence of postoperative refraction was predicted using conventional formulas, or {ML} models were calculated using the test data. We evaluated the {SRK}/T formula, Haigis formula, Holladay 1 formula, Hoffer Q formula, and Barrett Universal {II} formula ({BU}-{II}); similar to {ML} methods, we assessed support vector regression ({SVR}), random forest regression ({RFR}), gradient boosting regression ({GBR}), and neural network ({NN}). Among the conventional formulas, {BU}-{II} had the lowest mean and median absolute error of prediction. Therefore, we compared the accuracy of our method with that of {BU}-{II}. The absolute errors of some {ML} methods were lower than those of {BU}-{II}. However, no statistically significant difference was observed. Thus, the accuracy of our method was not inferior to that of {BU}-{II}.},
